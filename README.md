## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/username/fractol.git`
2. Compile the program: `make`
3. Run the program: `./fractol [fractal_name]`

## Usage

Fractol supports several different fractals, including the Mandelbrot set, Julia set, and Burning Ship fractal. To display a specific fractal, use the corresponding name as a command line argument when running the program. For example:

```bash
./fractol mandelbrot
./fractol julia
./fractol burning_ship
```
Once the program is running, use the following controls to navigate and explore the fractal:

Zoom: Use the scroll wheel to zoom in and out of the fractal.
Pan: Hold down the left mouse button and drag to pan around the fractal.
Iterations: Use the '+' and '-' keys to increase and decrease the number of iterations used to render the fractal.
Color: Use the 'C' key to cycle through different color palettes.
Reset: Press the 'R' key to reset the view to the default position and zoom level.
Note
The program has been tested on MacOS only.
